## Install module:
- If you get the module in a zip file (like when downloading it from the market place [Dolistore](https://www.dolistore.com)), go into
menu ```Home - Setup - Modules - Deploy external module``` and upload the zip file.


Note: If this screen tell you there is no custom directory, check your setup is correct: 

- In your Dolibarr installation directory, edit the ```htdocs/conf/conf.php``` file and check that following lines are not commented:

    ```php
    //$dolibarr_main_url_root_alt ...
    //$dolibarr_main_document_root_alt ...
    ```

- Uncomment them if necessary (delete the leading ```//```) and assign a sensible value according to your Dolibarr installation

    For example :

    - UNIX:
        ```php
        $dolibarr_main_url_root_alt = '/custom';
        $dolibarr_main_document_root_alt = '/var/www/Dolibarr/htdocs/custom';
        ```

    - Windows:
        ```php
        $dolibarr_main_url_root_alt = '/custom';
        $dolibarr_main_document_root_alt = 'C:/My Web Sites/Dolibarr/htdocs/custom';
        ```

if needed rename dolibarr_module_externalaccess folder to externalaccess
        


From your browser:

  - Log into Dolibarr as a super-administrator
  - Go to "Setup" -> "Modules"
  - You should now be able to find and enable the module
